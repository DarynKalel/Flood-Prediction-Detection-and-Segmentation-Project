# Flood-Prediction-Detection-and-Segmentation-Project

In this projet I built a flood area segmenataion and detection moedl.

Datasets: "Flood Area Segmentation" and "Kerala Rainfall dataset". 

Flood area Segmentatio Dataset contains images of flood hit areas and corresponding mask images showing the water region.

There are 290 images and self annoted masks. The mask images were created using Label Studio, an open source data labelling software. The task is to create a segmentation model, which can accurately segment out the water region in a given picture of a flood hit area.

Such models cane be used for flood surveys, better decision-making and planning. Because of less data, pre-trained models and data augmentation may be used.

Kerala Rainfall dataset contains data about rainfall over the years in the state of Kerala.
It contains the data month-wise and annual rainfall.
This data can be used for rainfall prediction and flood prediction.
